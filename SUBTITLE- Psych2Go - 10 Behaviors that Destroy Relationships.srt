00:00:06,350 --> 00:00:07,540
- [Amanda] Hello, Psych2Goers,

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:09,900
and welcome back to our channel.

4
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,670
We wanted to let you know

5
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,530
that it is your ongoing support

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:15,580
that helps us make
psychology and mental health

7
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,320
more accessible to everyone.

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,440
Thank you so very much
for all of your support.

9
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,880
Now, let's continue.

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,110
Why do relationships fall apart?

11
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:29,520
Relationships are complicated
as they are fragile.

12
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:34,270
Small mistakes can destroy years
of love, passion and trust,

13
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:37,300
but you may not realize
what you're doing wrong.

14
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:41,340
So here are 10 behaviors that
can damage any relationship

15
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,930
and may be affecting yours too.

16
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,363
Number one, you stonewall your partner.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,600
Do you avoid difficult
questions and conversations?

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,670
This bad habit is called stonewalling.

19
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,580
When you stonewall your partner,

20
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:00,400
you're actively avoiding
painful or emotional subjects,

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,530
but those subjects are important

22
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,260
to the health of your relationship.

23
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,480
By avoiding difficult conversations,

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:09,670
you're harboring unresolved
issues with your partner.

25
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,000
It's okay to table a hard
conversation every once in awhile

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,720
but ignoring an issue
doesn't make it go away.

27
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,920
Number two, you're too distracted.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,060
Do you give your partner
your undivided attention?

29
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,620
Do you text other people
when you're together?

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,380
Never underestimate the
value of quality time.

31
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:33,400
When you're together, your
partner wants to feel important.

32
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,470
They need to know that you
enjoy spending time with them.

33
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:38,070
But if you're distracted,

34
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,960
your partner may feel
ignored or neglected,

35
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:43,390
and your relationship may suffer.

36
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:46,340
Number three, you get defensive.

37
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:50,270
Few things are as
important as communication.

38
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,840
But what if your partner
tells you something

39
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,720
you don't wanna hear?

40
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,740
Your partner may, for example,

41
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:58,240
think they're doing all the
work in your relationship.

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,480
No one likes to hear negative feedback.

43
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:02,070
So how should you react

44
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,730
when your partner tells
you something is wrong?

45
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:08,550
Defensiveness can be
destructive to any relationship.

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,580
When you become defensive,

47
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,000
you stop listening to
your partner's concerns.

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,310
Instead, you try to protect yourself.

49
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:17,620
You may argue with them or turn
the tables on your partner,

50
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,200
either way, you're
ignoring the real problem

51
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,550
and your partner doesn't feel heard.

52
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:25,780
Number four, you criticize too often.

53
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,570
How often do you criticize your partner?

54
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,910
Even if you mean well,

55
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,070
critical behavior can drive
a wedge in your relationship.

56
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:35,710
Not only is it frustrating
for your partner,

57
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:38,450
excess criticism also
creates a negative dynamic

58
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:40,130
in your relationship.

59
00:02:40,130 --> 00:02:42,160
You lose track of why
you love your partner

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,220
because you're too
focused on their mistakes.

61
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,260
Number five, you idealize your partner.

62
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,870
Do you put your partner on a pedestal?

63
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:52,080
You love your partner,

64
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,430
so you may hold them to a high standard,

65
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:58,190
but idealizing your partner
can damage your relationship.

66
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,960
When you idealize your partner,

67
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,200
you're projecting your
own preferences onto them.

68
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,570
You love your partner for
the person they could be

69
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,810
not who they actually are.

70
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:12,250
Number six, you ignore your past.

71
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,230
No one is perfect.

72
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,860
Every relationship has
bumps and rough patches,

73
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,470
but ignoring your troubled past

74
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,560
could destroy your relationship.

75
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,240
Your history, good and bad,

76
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,740
is the reason you are where you are today.

77
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,130
It has shaped the way you
feel about your partner

78
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:30,410
and the way your partner feels about you.

79
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:31,770
By ignoring your past,

80
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:34,800
you're overlooking significant
moments in your relationship

81
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,950
and rejecting the struggles

82
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:38,560
your relationship has yet to overcome.

83
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,860
Number seven, you mislead your partner.

84
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,720
Have you ever told your partner
something you didn't mean?

85
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,990
Deception can easily
destroy a relationship.

86
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:51,750
Lies and manipulation ruin
the most important thing

87
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:55,370
you and your partner have
built together, trust.

88
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:57,020
When you stop being honest,

89
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:59,550
you give your partner
a reason to doubt you.

90
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,670
Honesty isn't always easy

91
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,950
and some things are better left unsaid,

92
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:08,610
but you should never try
to deceive your partner,

93
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,860
no matter what,

94
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:13,000
this kind of behavior will
destroy your relationship.

95
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,360
Number eight, you create competition.

96
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:20,459
In a healthy relationship,
partners don't keep score.

97
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:22,280
They don't care who's
right and who's wrong

98
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:25,710
because competition creates
tension, stress and resentment.

99
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:27,970
If you're always trying to
prove your partner wrong,

100
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:30,460
sooner or later, you're
going to drive them away.

101
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,550
Instead, by finding a solution

102
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,310
that makes both of you happy
and learning how to compromise,

103
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,210
you can create a healthier
relationship in the long run.

104
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:41,480
Number nine, you shame your partner.

105
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,420
Do you pick on your partner?

106
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,650
Many couples playfully
tease each other in private.

107
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:48,140
But making fun of your partner in public

108
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:50,090
can damage your relationship.

109
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,470
Instead of a playful back and forth,

110
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:55,060
you're openly shaming your
partner for their mistakes

111
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,350
and placing them in a very
uncomfortable situation.

112
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,880
And number 10, you expect too much.

113
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,100
Do you get angry when your
partner can't read your mind?

114
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,050
You expect your partner
to know what you want

115
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:09,520
and what you're thinking all the time,

116
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,740
but that's entirely unfair to them.

117
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:15,760
It's your responsibility to
vocalize the things you want.

118
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:16,860
If you don't express yourself,

119
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:19,730
your partner will never
know anything is wrong.

120
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:21,560
If you expect your
partner to magically know

121
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,040
all the answers, your relationship
may slowly fall apart.

122
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:29,020
Do you struggle with any of
these destructive behaviors?

123
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,440
Has your partner done things

124
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,470
that have damaged your relationship?
